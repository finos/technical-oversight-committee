# TOC Voting Process

To ensure accurate details of new project contributions are retained, the voting process requires a PR be raised by the TOC Project Liaison using the [ossf/security-insights specification](https://github.com/ossf/security-insights).

Once a project contribution is ready for the TOC to vote, the TOC Project Liaison should:

1. Fork the [TOC Repository](https://github.com/finos/technical-oversight-committee)
2. Copy the [template directory](../../../projects/template-project/) renaming with the name of the project contribution
3. Fill in the required details in the project-data.yaml file
4. Raise a PR, linking back to the TOC Checklist Issue. Use the template below for the PR description

> Proposal to accept {PROJECT NAME} as an incubating project.
>
> This resolves https://github.com/finos/technical-oversight-committee/issues/NNN  
>
> To be accepted for incubation, the project must receive a majority support of the TOC in the form of PR comments.
>
> All TOC members are expected to respond with votes within 5 business days of the date of this PR.
>
> Comments are welcome from anyone on the pull request to show support and help inform subsequent votes.
