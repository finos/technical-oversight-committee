# Project Contributions

- Project contributions are submitted via the [FINOS community project](https://github.com/finos/community) as issues, according to the [FINOS contribution process](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/software-projects/contribution/)
- The FINOS team perform initial validation, including completeness of the [Incubation checklist](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/software-projects/stages/incubating/#incubating-lifecycle-checklist) requirements, and encourage initial socialization with the FINOS community
- FINOS team indicates contributions are ready for TOC via the `ready-for-toc` label, adding them to the [TOC Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/finos/projects/39) and assigning tho the current TOC chair
- The TOC chair raises a new [Contribution Checklist](https://github.com/finos/technical-oversight-committee/issues/new?template=contribution-checklist.md) issue and assigns it to a TOC member
- TOC evaluates contribution using the [TOC contribution principles](https://github.com/finos/technical-steering-committee/blob/master/contribution-principles.md) and the [Incubation checklist](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/software-projects/stages/incubating/#incubating-lifecycle-checklist)
