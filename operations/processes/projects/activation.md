# Project Activations

 - Project activations are submitted via the [FINOS community project](https://github.com/finos/community) as issues, according to the [FINOS Activation Process](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/software-projects/stages/active/#initiating-activation)
 - The FINOS team perform initial validation, including completeness of the [Activation checklist](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/software-projects/stages/active/#activation-checklist) requirements
 - FINOS team indicates contributions are ready for TOC input via the `ready-for-toc` label, adding them to the [TOC Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/finos/projects/39) and assigning tho the current TOC chair

-  TOC assigns a TOC member to evaluate the activation and / or ask for contributors to present a TOC and answer questions / provide additional evidence.
 - A TOC member is assigned to evaluate the activation
 - The TOC member will provides particular scrutiny and exercise discretion on, but not limited to, these items:
   - Usefulness - is it clear what business problem this project is addressing? What are the use cases that it helps solve? What are its main benefits?
   - Community - how is the project being used and consumed? There may be different ways for firms/individuals to consume and contribute to a project, more or less relevant to assess its maturity.
