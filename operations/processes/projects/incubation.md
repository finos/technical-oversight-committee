# FINOS Incubating Projects

The Incubation level continues to nurture developing projects, where they will receive FINOS infrastructure, legal, and marketing benefits to help bolster their visibility and adoption. After acceptance, they must also adhere to ongoing maintenance requirements.

## Incubation Acceptance Requirements

- All Labs acceptance and maintenance requirements must be met in addition to the following:
- At least **two** maintainers from different organizations, **one** of which must be a FINOS member
- Active use by at least two financial services organizations
- At least one detailed end-user adoption story (public or private to the TOC)
- Consistent adherence to the contribution workflow described in the project’s CONTRIBUTING.md
- Project implements the appropriate governance structure according to FINOS policy
- A public roadmap or project backlog with target outcomes and timelines in or linked from the repo

## Incubation Ongoing Maintenance Requirements

The following must remain true for _Incubating_ projects at all times. A Health Review from the TOC should be expected every six months. Project support will be offered in the event that a project is found to be out of compliance. If a project remains out of compliance for three consecutive Health Reviews, it will qualify for archival.

- All _Incubation_ acceptance requirements and _Labs_ maintenance requirements
- Public tracking of activity using GitHub Issues
- A shortlist of public “Good First Issues” or “Help Wanted” remains accurate and up-to-date
- All open issues and discussions are replied to with reasonable promptness
- Publicly visible adherence to a project roadmap
- Pre-release integration with a FINOS-approved dependency and license scanner
- Build and release processes do not use any private or undocumented steps
- Presentation at a public TOC meeting at least once every six months
- Demonstrated adherence to **Maturity Level 2** of the [Open Source Project Security Baseline](https://baseline.openssf.org/)
