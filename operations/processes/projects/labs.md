# FINOS Labs Projects

Labs projects are in an initial exploratory phase, hosted in a neutral space overseen by FINOS. They must comply with a formal checklist defined by the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) and enforced by the FINOS team. After acceptance, they must also adhere to a short list of ongoing maintenance requirements.

## Labs Acceptance Requirements

The following factors must be confirmed before the project can be accepted and onboarded as a FINOS Labs Project.

Project support will be offered in the event that a project is found to be out of compliance. If a project remains out of compliance for two consecutive Health Reviews, it will qualify for archival.
