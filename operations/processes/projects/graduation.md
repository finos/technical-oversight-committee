# FINOS Graduated Projects

Graduated projects represent the highest level of project maturity. To achieve Graduated status, projects must meet OSPS Baseline Level 3 requirements in addition to other requirements. In recognition of this achievement, Graduated projects receive a more extensive list of FINOS benefits to further enhance their presence and impact.

## Graduated Project Acceptance Requirements

- All Incubation maintenance requirements must be met in addition to the following:
- The project has adhered to its roadmap during Incubation
- The project is self-sufficient without significant support from FINOS staff
- Project has made a production-ready major release, and announced it to [announce@lists.finos.org](mailto:announce@lists.finos.org)
- Maintainers from at least **three** different organizations, **one** of which must be a FINOS member
- Actively used by at least **five** organizations, with at least **three** from financial services
- **Two** or more end-user adoption stories or case studies that can be publicly shared
- The project must publish and adhere to FINOS-approved security policy
- Root-level README.md must contain links to accurate and up-to-date usage and maintenance documentation
- The project has worked with FINOS Staff to create a community sustainability plan which includes a go-to-market strategy
- Project documentation starts with a clear, unique financial services value proposition

## Ongoing Maintenance Requirements

The following must remain true for _Graduated_ projects at all times. A Health Review from the TOC will be executed every six months. Project support will be offered in the event that a project is found to be out of compliance. If a project remains out of compliance for three consecutive Health Reviews, it will qualify for archival.

- All feature work adheres to a public roadmap
- Demonstrated progress against the Community Development Plan milestones
- Demonstrated adherence to **Maturity Level 3** of the [Open Source Project Security Baseline](https://baseline.openssf.org/)
