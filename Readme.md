# üìã  FINOS Technical Steering Committee

This FINOS Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is the technical governing body of [FINOS](https://www.finos.org/). We work in close collaboration with the [FINOS team](https://www.finos.org/team) and the [Governing Board](https://www.finos.org/governing-board) to provide technical oversight for the projects in the FINOS portfolio.

The exact mandate of the TSC is still being defined. However, at a very high level the intention is that:

 - The FINOS Special Interest Groups focus on the ‚Äòproblem space‚Äô, with their activities aligned the Governing Board
 - Projects focus on the ‚Äòsolution space‚Äô, with their activities aligned to the TSC

## TSC Formation

The FINOS TSC is currently in formation. The following gives a brief overview of the process to date:

 - 4 May 2022 - TSC announced at [FINOS All Community Call](https://github.com/finos/community/issues/183)

## TSC initial focus

During the TSC trial period we are pursuing the dual goals of:

 1. Create a viable structure for the TSC that will endure (e.g. election processes, voting, terms of reference)
 2. Provide guidance and decision-making input for a number of in-flight initiatives.

With reference to (2), the following are likely areas of focus:

 - Review existing [contribution process](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Software-Projects/contribution) and [incubation checklist](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Software-Projects/stages/incubating)
 - Advise on current (3+) in-flight [proposed project contributions](https://github.com/finos/community/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acontribution)
 - Integrate OpenSSF badges in project lifecycle - as measure of ‚Äúopen source maturity‚Äù
 - Recommendations to budget committee & Q3 GB meeting on project discretionary funding

## Ways of Working

The group favours an asynchonous way of working, allowing members to participate without the need to align calendars. To support this, we will use thf following communication channels:

 - We use [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/finos/technical-steering-committee/discussions) as our primary mechanism for discussing and collaboration
 - We use the email distribution list (tsc@lists.finos.org) for announcements (e.g. announcing a meeting)
 - We use our regular (minuted) meetings primarily for planning
 - We have ad-hoc meetings as and when they are needed. These will not be minuted.

We will hold regular minuted meetings, this will:

 - Take place bi-weekly, 4pm (UTC) Thursday
 - The agenda will be circulated in advance
 - All TSC members are welcoem to add agenda items
 - If we do not have any items for a given meeting, we will cancel
