## Responsibilities

The responsibilities of this group, together with the processes we have put in place to support them, are [detailed on this page](operations.md).

## Ways of Working

To support ongoing work, we use the following communication channels:

 - Our overall backlog of work is organised via a [GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/finos/projects/39).
 - We use [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/finos/technical-oversight-committee/discussions) as our primary mechanism for discussing and collaboration.
 - We use the email distribution list (toc@lists.finos.org) for announcements (e.g. announcing a meeting).
 - We use our private Tuesday meetings primarily for TOC planning.
 - We use our public Wednesday meetings primarily for FINOS project and SIG presentations as well as for other community updates.
 - We have ad-hoc meetings as and when they are needed. These will not be minuted.
