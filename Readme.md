# 📋  FINOS Technical Steering Committee

This FINOS Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is the technical governing body of [FINOS](https://www.finos.org/). We work in close collaboration with the [FINOS team](https://www.finos.org/team) and the [Governing Board](https://www.finos.org/governing-board) to provide technical oversight for the projects in the FINOS portfolio.

The exact mandate of the TSC is still being defined. However, at a very high level the intention is that:

 - The FINOS Special Interest Groups focus on the ‘problem space’, with their activities aligned the Governing Board
 - Projects focus on the ‘solution space’, with their activities aligned to the TSC

## TSC Formation

The FINOS TSC is currently in formation. The following gives a brief overview of the process to date:

 - 13 Jan 2022 - initial concept shared with community, see [FINOS Technical Steering Committee [TSC] Request for Comments [RFC]](https://github.com/finos/community/issues/153) 
 - 21 Feb 2022 - TSC formation shared with community, [FINOS TSC Elections and Formation - Request for Comments [RFC]](https://github.com/finos/community/issues/162)
 - 20 April 2022 - FINOS Governing Board approved the formation of a TSC on a trial basis (circa 6 months)
 - 21 April 2022 - call for TSC nominations from the Governing Board, deadline 29 April
 - 4 May 2022 - TSC announced at [FINOS All Community Call](https://github.com/finos/community/issues/183)

## TSC initial focus

During the TSC trial period we are pursuing the dual goals of:

 1. Create a viable structure for the TSC that will endure (e.g. election processes, voting, terms of reference)
 2. Provide guidance and decision-making input for a number of in-flight initiatives.

With reference to (2), the following are likely areas of focus:

 - Review existing [contribution process](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Software-Projects/contribution) and [incubation checklist](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Software-Projects/stages/incubating)
 - Advise on current (3+) in-flight [proposed project contributions](https://github.com/finos/community/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acontribution)
 - Integrate OpenSSF badges in project lifecycle - as measure of “open source maturity”
 - Recommendations to budget committee & Q3 GB meeting on project discretionary funding
