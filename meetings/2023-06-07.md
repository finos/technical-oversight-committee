## Minutes

### Discussion on project activation

For reference, the lifecycle is documented [here](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/software-projects/project-lifecycle/).

 - We discussed the current TSC responsibility for project activation - documented [here](https://github.com/finos/technical-steering-committee/blob/master/responsibilities.md#project-activations), where we provide feedback regarding the usefulness, community and roadmap of a given project
 - At the moment this assessment is entirely subjective
 - A discussion was held regarding whether we need to have a more precise definition of how this assessment is undertaken
 - We had a further discussion around the overall project lifecycle
 - Contrasting with CNCF, documented [here](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/README.md), their lifecycle also has significant due diligence, but only at the point where a project moves from sandbox to incubation. The transition to graduation is less structured and involves less due diligence.
 - The FINOS transition from incubating to active is an equivalent transition
 - A discussion was held around whether the FINOS lifecycle could be simplified to more closely resemble that of CNCF
 - A conclusion wasn't reached on either discussion topic.
