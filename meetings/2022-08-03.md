## TSC Meeting - 8th August 2022

In our previous meeting we discussed the [Regnosys contribution of their Rosetta DSL](https://github.com/finos/technical-steering-committee/blob/master/meetings/2022-07-20.md#regnosys-contribution), as outlined in their [contribution issue](https://github.com/finos/community/issues/197).

The purpose of this meeting was for the Regnosys team to demonstrate their contribution and field questions.

## Minutes
 
 - Nigel gave an overview / walk through of the [contribution issue](https://github.com/finos/community/issues/197), discussing the business problem and the solution they developed.
 - Minesh gave a walk-thought of their [approach to open source](https://rosetta-technology.io/open-source), detailing the open source core (Rosetta DSL, generators), the models people create and the value-add UI tooling and execution engine that are the core of their commercial offering
 - Their main motives for contributing this project (which is already open source) into FINOS are:
   - access to a wider community
   - better connectivity with other FINOS activities (SIGs)
   - further integration with Morphir
   - exploring other FINOS projects, e.g. Symphony, and how they might integrate, GCP
   - to help with the formalisation of their own open source practices
 - Rosetta currently has 8 code generators
  - there are new ones in the pipeline (Elm, Python)
  - other code generators have already been provided by the community
 - Rosetta is already used by ISDA for publishing their [Common Domain Model (CDM)](https://www.isda.org/2019/10/14/isda-common-domain-model/)
  - currently the ISDA CDM is 'open source', but available to download on request    
 - They do have proprietary components (UI, runtime engine), however they intend to open source some of these in 2023
 - The core technology behind the DSL is the Eclipse Modelling Framework (EMF), using Ecore as its meta-model. As a result, anything written in Rosetta is natively available as Ecore, which gives access to a wider ecosystem of tools
 - Nigel provided a demonstration of the Regnosys platform, which includes their execution engine and UI tooling.
   - This is the community edition, which is freely available for people collaborating on public data models
   - Alternatively, you can edit these models within Eclipse
 - With their 'core' already being open source, we discussed their development practices
   - they work directly in the same project, they do have some internal additional processes, but generally speaking, external contributors are on an 'equal footing' with the Regnosys team.
