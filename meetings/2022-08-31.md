## Minutes

### Meeting attendance level

 - it was noted that the attendance level for this meeting was particularly low
 - there was speculation around whether this was due to holidays, or the high frequency of these meetings
 - **ACTION:** Colin to poll TSC members to determine how frequently we should meet
 - **ACTION:** FINOS Team to determine how we gain visibility of meeting 'declines' in order to help us better manage meetings

### Agreement of contribution principles

 - The TSC members present were in broad agreement that the [contribution principles](https://github.com/finos/technical-steering-committee/discussions/19) are fit for purpose. However, there is a need to create consensus.
 - It was suggested, and agreed, that we should seek agreement from 50% of the TSC
 - Gab noted that we need visibility of the principles in draft form, to accompany our [Rosetta recommendation](https://github.com/finos/community/issues/197#issuecomment-1227470853).
 - **ACTION:** Colin to poll TSC members for approval of the principles
 - **ACTION:** Colin to share a draft version of the principles with Gab

### We debated the process for making this repo public

 - Gab indicated that that making this public is vital to the operation of the TSC
 - The TSC members present were happy this in principle
 - It was requested that a legal disclaimer is added to the README file which states that opinions expressed by TSC members are their own, and are not to be seen as a statement of their employer.
 - With the above in place, we should move to making this repo public
 - **ACTION:** Rob to work with LF legal to add this disclaimer

### Next steps for the TSC

  - Gab has created a [project board](https://github.com/orgs/finos/projects/39) which we can use for managing TSC activities. All agreed that this looks like a suitable approach.
  - **ACTION:** Colin to add current and previous TSC projects onto the board
  - Gab highlighted the [OpenSSF contribution](https://github.com/finos/community/pull/185)
    - historically the FINOS team have had their own security requirements.
    - They have been looking at the overlap between the OpenSSF badge and what they currently have
    - Move to leveraging the OpenSSF badge at various levels
    - The first step is to look at how this is employed in the 'active' stage
    - **ACTION:** to explore how we bring this to the TSC for consideration
  - There are two further contributions, one from Mao, the other from Syncatron, would be good to take a look
    - **ACTION:** to explore how we bring these to the TSC for consideration
